# Focus Bear: Company Reflection

## Why Focus Bear Was Created

Focus Bear was made to help people who have trouble focusing, especially those with ADHD or autism. The people who created it understand these challenges well because they've experienced them themselves. It's not just another appâ€”it's a helpful tool made specifically for people who need extra support with staying focused, managing their time, and building good habits.

## The Problem Focus Bear Solves

In today's world, it's hard for everyone to stay focused, but it's especially tough for people with ADHD or similar challenges. Focus Bear helps by:

- Blocking distracting websites when needed
- Helping build good habits step by step
- Giving tools to stay productive
- Making sure work and personal life stay balanced

## Why Focus Bear's Mission Matters
- Gives help to people in a world full of distractions
- Keeps work and life in balance
- Builds habits that make life better
- Makes it easier to talk about focus challenges

## My Experience with Focus Challenges
As someone who personally experience mental issues and ADHD, the mission resonates with me. As I have discussed with Jeremy, I want to find a way to contribute to the project and help people with mental issue improve in their learning and work.

## How Focus Bear Could Help Others

I haven't known anyone with ADHD or autism at university, but I can see how Focus Bear could help different people. The app's way of building habits slowly could help people improve over time, while features like website blocking give quick help when needed.
