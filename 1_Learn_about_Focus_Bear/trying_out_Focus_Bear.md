I tried the Mac app


- During registration, no System events popped up, making the next step not progressable.
- At the beginning, the Mac application was sticky on top of other windows, including the OAuth for google registration.
- The AI focus mode blocks many webpage. For example, task "writing report" blocks overleaf, many google.com and pdf files for reading research papers, etc.
