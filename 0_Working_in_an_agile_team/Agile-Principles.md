## What is Agile?
Agile is a project management and product development approach that consist of \:
- Iterative development
- Continuous feedback
- Flexibility and adaptability
- Customer collaboration
- Delivering working software frequently

## Agile vs. Traditional Project Management
- Traditional project management requires detailed upfront planning while Agile follows adaptive planning.
- Agile embraces changes throughout development.
- Traditional project management focuses on big releases while Agile delivers frequent small releases.
- Traditional project management limits customer involvement to requirements while Agile maintains continuous collaboration.
- Traditional project management emphasizes heavy documentation while Agile prioritizes working software over documentation.
- Traditional project management follows a linear waterfall process while Agile uses an iterative and incremental approach.
## Core Values of Agile (Agile Manifesto)
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Core Principles of Agile2
1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery
2. Welcome changing requirements
3. Deliver working software frequently
4. Business people and developers must work together
5. Build projects around motivated individuals
6. Face-to-face conversation is most effective
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
10. Simplicity is essential
11. Self-organizing teams
12. Regular reflection and adaptation

## Scrum vs. Kanban

#### Scrum
- Time-boxed iterations (sprints)
- Fixed roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Team)
- Prescribed ceremonies (Daily Standup, Sprint Planning, etc.)
- Commitment to sprint goals
- Best for projects with stable requirements

#### Kanban
- Continuous flow
- Flexible roles
- Visual workflow management
- Work in Progress (WIP) limits
- Best for maintenance and support work

### Why Focus Bear Uses Kanban
- The flexible and continuous development approach allows the team to adapt quickly to changing requirements while maintaining a steady flow of work through the development pipeline
- The visual workflow management system provides clear visibility of task status and bottlenecks across distributed team members, enabling better coordination and efficient handoffs between different stages of development
- The work-in-progress limits help prevent context switching and maintain high quality output by ensuring team members can focus deeply on their current tasks without getting overwhelmed by too many concurrent responsibilities

## Benefits 
- Faster delivery of value
- Better adaptability to change
- Better team collaboration

## Challenges
- Requires cultural change
- Needs strong communication
- Requires discipline and commitment

## Scrum vs. Kanban Summary
- While Scrum operates on fixed-length sprints with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, Kanban emphasizes a continuous flow of work with more flexible role assignments, allowing team members to take on different responsibilities based on current needs and capacity.
- Scrum's structured approach includes specific ceremonies like daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives, along with defined artifacts such as product backlogs and sprint backlogs, whereas Kanban focuses primarily on visualizing the workflow through a board system with work-in-progress limits to optimize the flow of tasks through different stages of development.
- Scrum is particularly effective for projects with relatively stable requirements and clear sprint goals, as it provides a framework for planning and executing work in fixed time periods, while Kanban is better suited for maintenance work, support tasks, and projects with frequently changing priorities, as it allows for more fluid adaptation to new requirements and immediate response to urgent issues.
