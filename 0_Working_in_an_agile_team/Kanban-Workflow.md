# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
A Kanban board is a visual workflow management tool that helps teams:
- Visualize work
- Limit work in progress
- Maximize efficiency
- Improve flow

### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
- Backlog: Tasks waiting to be started, prioritized list of work items, source of new work for the team
- Todo: tasks ready to be worked on, clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- In Progress: Assigned and active
- Blocked: Task that can only progress once depedent tasks are resolved
- Done: Finished task

### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?

- **Task Movement**
  - Pull-based system (work is pulled when capacity allows)
  - Moves left to right through columns
  - Each move represents progress
  - Blocked items return to flow when unblocked

- **Responsibility**
  - Team members update their own tasks
  - Daily updates during stand-ups
  - Blockers are raised immediately
  - Status changes are made in real-time

## What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
- Fewer context switches, leading to better quality of work and reduced multitasking

## How Kanban Helps Manage Priorities
- Visual representation of workload
- Clear understanding of capacity, keeping track on the progress of the team as a whole
- Better resource allocation

## Improving Your Workflow with Kanban
- Be aware and set personal WIP limits
- Visualize my own workload, remove bottlenecks

## Task Tracking Improvements
- Regular Updates on the Kanban board to improve transparency and help others keep track of the progress
- Collaborative reviews: communicate effectively with other team members
- Continuously refine WIP
