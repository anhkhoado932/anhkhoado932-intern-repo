# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

## Daily Stand-ups
- A 15-minute daily meeting where team members share:
  - What they worked on yesterday
  - What they plan to work on today
  - Any blockers or impediments
- Purpose: Quick alignment, identify blockers early

## Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)
- **Sprint Planning (Scrum)**
  - Time-boxed meeting at the start of each sprint
  - Team selects work from the backlog for the upcoming sprint
  - Creates sprint goals and commitment
- **Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)**
  - Ongoing process of managing work items
  - Focus on flow and limiting work in progress

## Retrospectives
- Regular meeting (typically at the end of each sprint)
- Team reflects on:
  - What went well
  - What could be improved
  - Action items for improvement
- Purpose: Continuous improvement and team growth

## Backlog Refinement
- Regular meeting to review and prepare backlog items
- Activities include:
  - Breaking down large items
  - Adding details and acceptance criteria
  - Estimating effort
  - Prioritizing work
- Purpose: Ensure backlog is ready for future sprints

## Asynchronous Collaboration Across Time Zones

- Project management software (Jira, Trello, etc.) to keep track of ongoing work
- Communication platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams)
- Documentation tools (Confluence, Notion) for meeting notes, shared documentations, handoffs


## How Agile Ceremonies Help with Communication and Alignment

Agile ceremonies provide structured opportunities for:
- Regular communication and updates
- Shared understanding of goals and progress
- Early identification of blockers
- Continuous feedback and improvement
- Team bonding and relationship building

## Most Important Ceremony for My Role
- Daily standup: To keep an update on the team progress, express any blocks I am currently facing and find the correct contact/direction for me to move forward

## How I Can Improve Team Collaboration
- Consistent communication
- Regular feedback and review of my own work
- Keeping updates brief and informative in daily standups.
